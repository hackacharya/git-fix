Scripts for recovering git repos from loose object errors


Couple of Bad Power situations and Bad shutdowns / restarts ? 
Annoying GIT errors and you figure that's the only copy

Cleanup A the view and make it usable again assume everything
is checked in and pushed. Your Unpushed COMMITS MAY be lost with
this script

If you get following type of errors in your git local repo and also 
WANT to restart using your view, (but not necessarily
recover) - (see the forceclean option)

>> error: object file .git/objects/../..... is empty
>> fatal: loose object ............ (stored in .git/object....
>> error: HEAD: invalid sha1 pointer ....
>> error: refs/heads/master does not point to a valid object!
>> dangling tree  ... 
>> dangling tree ...
